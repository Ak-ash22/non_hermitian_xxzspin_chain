# non_hermitian_xxzspin_chain

Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have attracted research interest in recent years, among which the PT -symmetric systems are focused more. Motivated by recent advances in this field, this project analyzes the behaviour of such systems by taking an example. I have used the recently developed theory of ‘Biorthogonal quantum mechanics’ in case for finite dimensional Hilbert space to study the properties of a NH system. In this project, an interacting NH system is investigated for the presence of exceptional points and the region of PT -symmetry unbroken and PT -symmetry broken phases. The system is also studied for the properties of entanglement entropy and entropy dynamics in PT symmetry unbroken phase.
